# Local Tech Support System: Java CLI to React Migration Plan

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete strategy for migrating the existing Java CLI application into a modern React web application while maintaining 100% functional parity, implementing robust development practices, and following a disciplined git workflow throughout the process.

### Current System Analysis
- **Architecture**: Java 17 + Maven + PicoCLI + OkHttp + Jackson
- **Features**: 6 main menu categories, 8 direct commands, full CRUD operations
- **Models**: 5 core entities (Client, Technician, Ticket, Appointment, Statistics)
- **Testing**: 12 unit tests with MockWebServer integration
- **API Endpoints**: 25+ REST endpoints with comprehensive functionality

## 🎯 Migration Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Objectives
1. **Complete Feature Parity**: All CLI functionality replicated in web interface
2. **Modern User Experience**: Intuitive, responsive web application
3. **Maintainable Codebase**: TypeScript, comprehensive testing, clean architecture
4. **Seamless API Integration**: Preserve existing REST API endpoints
5. **Git Hygiene**: Disciplined branching strategy with proper documentation

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Development Velocity**: Complete migration in 8 weeks (56 days)
- **Code Quality**: >80% test coverage, TypeScript strict mode, ESLint compliance
- **Performance**: <2s initial load, <500ms API responses, >90 Lighthouse score
- **User Experience**: Mobile responsive, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- **Git Quality**: Clear commit history, proper branch management, no merge conflicts

## 🌳 Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
```
main (production-ready code)
├── develop (integration branch)
├── feature/phase-1-foundation
│   ├── feature/project-setup
│   ├── feature/typescript-types
│   ├── feature/base-components
│   └── feature/api-integration
├── feature/phase-2-core-entities
│   ├── feature/client-management
│   ├── feature/technician-management
│   └── feature/ticket-management
├── feature/phase-3-advanced
│   ├── feature/appointment-system
│   └── feature/reports-analytics
├── feature/phase-4-production
│   ├── feature/performance-optimization
│   └── feature/production-deployment
└── hotfix/critical-fixes (if needed)
```

### Branching Workflow
1. **Main Branch**: Always production-ready, protected, requires PR reviews
2. **Develop Branch**: Integration branch for completed features
3. **Feature Branches**: Individual feature development, merged to develop
4. **Phase Branches**: Organize features by development phases
5. **Hotfix Branches**: Critical fixes, merged directly to main and develop

### Branch Naming Conventions
```
feature/phase-{number}-{feature-name}
feature/{specific-feature}
hotfix/{issue-description}
release/v{version-number}
```

### Commit Message Standards
```
feat: add client management table component
fix: resolve API connection timeout issue
docs: update README with setup instructions
test: add unit tests for client service
refactor: improve component structure
chore: update dependencies
```

### Pull Request Process
1. **Feature → Develop**: All features must go through develop first
2. **Develop → Main**: Only after phase completion and testing
3. **Required Reviews**: At least 1 reviewer for features, 2 for main
4. **CI/CD Checks**: All tests pass, build successful, linting clean
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with each significant change

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Strategy

### Frontend Technology Stack
```typescript
Core Framework: React 18 + TypeScript 5.x
Build Tool: Vite (faster development, better HMR)
Routing: React Router v6 (declarative routing)
State Management: Zustand (lightweight, minimal boilerplate)
UI Framework: Mantine v7 (comprehensive component library)
Forms: React Hook Form + Zod (performance + validation)
API Layer: Axios + TanStack Query (caching + synchronization)
Testing: Vitest + Testing Library + MSW
Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier + Husky
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Target: >80% coverage)
```typescript
// Component testing example
describe('ClientList', () => {
  it('should render clients table with data', async () => {
    render(<ClientList />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('table')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should handle client creation', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(<ClientForm />);
    
    await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('First Name'), 'Jane');
    await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('Last Name'), 'Smith');
    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' }));
    
    expect(mockCreateClient).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      firstName: 'Jane',
      lastName: 'Smith'
    });
  });
});

// Hook testing example
describe('useClients', () => {
  it('should fetch and return clients data', async () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useClients());
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(result.current.isSuccess).toBe(true);
    });
    
    expect(result.current.data).toHaveLength(3);
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing
```typescript
// API integration testing with MSW
const server = setupServer(
  rest.get('/api/clients', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json(mockClientsResponse));
  }),
  rest.post('/api/clients', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json(mockCreatedClient));
  })
);

describe('Client Management Integration', () => {
  beforeAll(() => server.listen());
  afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
  afterAll(() => server.close());

  it('should display clients from API and allow creation', async () => {
    render(<ClientsPage />);
    
    // Wait for data to load
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    
    // Test client creation
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'New Client' }));
    // ... rest of test
  });
});
```
